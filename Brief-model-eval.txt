ML/DL Classification Notes

Dataset: 1.4+ million track updates from upwards 40000 scenarios. Evenly split into 6 different possible classifications.

ALL CURRENT BEST HYPERPARAMS CAN BE FOUND INSIDE CLASSIFICATION PYTHON CODE

I can get updated exact demo percentages for each model if needed. 

DL:
Feed-forward NN
	Decent prediction time (~ .6 seconds on average), begins overfitting after 600 epochs training. Reach 93-94% accuracy on generated test data. Poor accuracy on demo data. Can get more recent analysis with demo percentage as well if needed.
RNN with LSTM
	Slow down in prediction time, similar accuracy to Feed-forward NN. No real benefit.
CNN with State Covariance Matrix in a combined model with feed-forward NN (not ensemble)
	Much slower prediction time, slightly better performance than feed-forward NN on generated data. Not noticable difference on demo data.

ML:
KNN
	Great prediction time (~ .15 seconds on average), reaches accuracy 98+% on generated test data. Mediocre at best on demo. 
GB
	Fantastic prediction time (~ .06-.08 seconds on average), reaches accuracy 99+% on generated test data. Current best demo model. 
Random Forrest
	Huge model size, similar prediction time to KNN, performs worse than knn on generated test data and demo data.
Naive Bayes
	Not worth mentioning
